Classic Snake Game

This was my take on the Udemy Academy: 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021
day 20 challenge to create a Snake game with the use of the Turtle module. This was the project that taught
me the most on how to integrate different aspects of OOP into my main.py file and get things to run smoothly.

The game is controlled through the use of the arrow keys. The snake will die and the game will reset if the snake
touches the walls or itself during gameplay. The High Score is tracked through writing to a .txt file.

I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did creating it!
